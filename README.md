# Hybrid-CNN
This project combines a CNN-based feature extraction model, similar to VGGNet, with an SVM classifier for object classification. Leveraging CNNs for deep feature extraction and SVMs for classification can yield improved performance, especially on smaller datasets or when focusing on precise feature extraction rather than end-to-end learning.
